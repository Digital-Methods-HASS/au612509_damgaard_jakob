```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Use R to figure out how many elements in the vector below are greater than 2 

```{r 1)}
#Installing packages
install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)

#Initializing the vector
rooms <- c(1, 2, 1, 3, 1, NA, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, NA, 1, 8, 3, 1, 4, NA, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 7, 1, NA)

#Filtering out all NAs 
rooms <- rooms[!is.na(rooms)]

#Counting number of elements with a value above 2
length(rooms[rooms>2])
```

## What is the result of running median() function on the above 'rooms' vector?

```{r 2)}

```
